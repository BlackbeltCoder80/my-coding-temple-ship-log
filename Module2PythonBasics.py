#Topic:5 Errors in Python: Navigating the Bumps on the Road of Coding

# Exercise: 1. The Forgotten Quote
# Imagine writing a letter and forgetting to close the envelope. The contents might fall out!
# Exercise; Correct the syntax error following Python statement:

print("Hello, World!")

# Exercise 2. The Mismatched Socks

# It's like trying to pair a sock with a glove. They just dont match!
# Exercise: Identify the logic erro in the code. It's meant to check if the numebr is odd:

num = 7
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even!")
else:
    print("the number is odd!")
    
# Exercise 3. The overeager Greeter
# Imagine a robot that's programmed to greet every red object However, it starts greeting everything that has a bit of red, even pink or maroon.

# Exercise: Find the logic error in the code which is meant to greet only the color red:

color = "red"
if color == "red":
    print("Hello, red!")
else:
    print("You're not red!")

x= 7
y= 5
print(x<y)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in fruits:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

def is_odd(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
